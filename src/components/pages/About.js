        Staight out of HighSchool I worked as a IT in the Government of Canada
        under a 1 year contract. After the year my contract was suppose to get
        extended but due to covid I was dismissed. Fortunately the Governement
        had something for the people who lost there Jobs and offered money till
        the individual found a job. So at the time I was getting bored at my
        mom's house. My dad was working at Oracle at the time and told me to
        learn to code and told me that he could've offered me a position at his
        company as a software Developer. I thought why not and I decided to
        learn Python. After studying the basics I realize that I was not
        applying these skills to nothing. I was literally creating functions and
        creating small games. I remember telling my self that I would not be
        able to do nothing with just knowing the syntax and couple of functions.
        So I decided to apply to a coding bootcamp. That's when my real coding
        journey started!
